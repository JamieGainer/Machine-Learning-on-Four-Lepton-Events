# Machine-Learning-on-Four-Lepton-Events

## Introduction

This repository is intended to provide a toolkit and examples
for studying Higgs to four-lepton events, such as those produced
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using various machine learning
techniques.  Questions of interest include the sensitivity of various
approaches as well as which variables/ what physical principles drive 
that sensitivity.

Since there are two antiicpated user groups: (i) physicists interested
in machine learning and (ii) machine learning experts interested in 
physics, I will try to provide explanations that are comprehensible
to both user groups (at the risk of belaboring the obvious).

I will now describe each subfolder of the repository, as I can
anticipate users being interested only in some of these subfolders.

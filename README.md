# Machine Learning on Four Lepton Events

## Low Priority, Will Return to Eventually

## Introduction

This repository will provide a toolkit and examples
for studying Higgs to four-lepton events, such as those produced
at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, using various machine learning
techniques.  Questions of interest include the sensitivity of various
approaches as well as which variables/ what physical principles drive 
that sensitivity.

Since there are two antiicpated user groups: (i) physicists interested
in machine learning and (ii) machine learning experts interested in 
physics, I will try to provide explanations that are comprehensible
to both user groups (at the risk of belaboring the obvious).

On the physics front: I am going to *initially* focus on distinguishing
the Higgs signal from the q qbar -> Z Z/gamma* backgrounds.
This is simpler from a machine learning standpoint in that we are comparing
two simple hypotheses.  Extending this to the case of measuring Higgs
properties (i.e. determining the correct point in a parameter space
describing Higgs couplings) is envisioned as a future direction.
